Title

Deep Learning-Based Classification of Motor Imagery EEG Signals for Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) Applications

Description:

This project implements a CNN-based deep learning pipeline to classify EEG motor imagery (MI) signals corresponding to the imagination of left hand, right hand, tongue, and foot movements.
The data were collected using the OpenBCI ultracortex Mark IV EEG headset (16 channels, 125 Hz) and preprocessed for offline classification.
The system aims to create a suitable for the robust and effective classification of EEG-MI signals with further applications enabling assistive control (e.g., wheelchair navigation) using BCI.
